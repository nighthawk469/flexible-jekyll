# Description
--------------

For statistics class, I used various online datasets and cleaned and analyzed them using NumPy/Pandas. I used Pandas to analyze things like confidence intervals and probability, and then afterwards visualized the data findings using Matplotlib.


# Examples
--------------

[Pandas Notebook 1 - Airbnb Data](https://github.com/nighthawk469/A1_statistics_ipython/blob/master/A1%20Airbnb%20Data.ipynb)

- Used the data in order to see what percentage of user sessions result in an airbnb booking
- Found what day of the week users are most active
- Determined the distribution of devices users use to access the site

[Pandas Notebook 2 - IGN Game Scores](https://github.com/nighthawk469/A2-statistics-ign-game-data/blob/master/A2%20IGN%20Game%20Data.ipynb)

- Used a histogram to show the frequency distribution of IGN game scores
- Determined the most popular genres and platforms
- Found probability of any game having score over 8/10

[Pandas Notebook 3 - iPhone vs Android Speedtest](https://github.com/nighthawk469/A5-statistics-phone-speed/blob/master/A5.ipynb)

- Created graphical distribution of iOS and Android manufacturers
- Calculated averages of a many country's internet speeds
- Calculated confidence intervals for download speeds
