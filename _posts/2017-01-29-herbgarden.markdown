# Description

- Created entire self watering herb garden system by **myself** for my school club.
- Engineered Arduino circuit that uses a moisture sensor to measure soil data. When the soil is dry, it activates a water pump to water the herbs
- Created website and used Plotly graphing library to display soil moisture data to spectators
- Configured Raspberry Pi to run Python program on system startup to save sensor data to a file and upload that file online
