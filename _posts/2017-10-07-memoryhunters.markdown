- Integrated ARCore into the Unity scene

### Summary
While attending Electric City Hackathon at Trent University, our team created a social network that lets users post messages at real locations throughout the world for other people to read.

## Inspiration
We were inspired by Pokemon Go where users had to travel around their neighbourhood to find Pokemon. We had a similar idea but to travel around our neighbourhood to share our personal stories. We think sharing stories is a great way to build connection. There is a popular Facebook page called "Humans of New York" and it shares stories about different people which makes us feel empathetic, we were also inspired by this idea.

## What it does
The app allow users to upload memories to their current location. If another user wants to view the contents of that memory, they need to go to the same location where the memory was posted. Whats so interesting about our app is that users need to go visit the location to read the message, this adds so much intrigue to our application that isn't available in any other social network. To view the memory the user will view it in Augmented Reality using Google ARCore.
