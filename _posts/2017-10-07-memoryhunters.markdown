# Winner of Best Adventure Hack üèÜ
--------------

### Summary
While attending Electric City Hackathon at Trent University, our team created a social network that goes beyond our screens; we created a social network that is much more interactive in our daily lives. Instead of simply posting personal memories to a feed like Instagram, users will post their memories to their 'current location', which allows other users the amazing experience of only experiencing these memories as they walk throughout their day.

## My Contributions 
- I had the initial idea for the project
- I did C# logic programming in Unity
- Integrated ARCore into the Unity scene

## Inspiration
We were inspired by Pokemon Go where users had to travel around their neighbourhood to find Pokemon. We had a similar idea but to travel around our neighbourhood to share our personal stories. We think sharing stories is a great way to build connection. There is a popular Facebook page called "Humans of New York" and it shares stories about different people which makes us feel empathetic, we were also inspired by this idea.

## What it does
The app allow users to upload memories to their current location. If another user wants to view the contents of that memory, they need to go to the same location where the memory was posted. To view the memory the user will view it in Augmented Reality using Google ARCore.
