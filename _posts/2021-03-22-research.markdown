# Overview

I developed a unique recommender system model in PyTorch to give video game recommendations based on an input video game. The model is a neural network based matrix factorization model.

After our model is trained, it assigns a vector value to each video game. We use nearest neighbor search to find nearby vectors which are recommendations.

# Vector Visualization

We can plot our video game vectors and see what items are close by. We can note that the games are of similar genre.

# Recommendation Example

In the image below we are given a list of recommendations for the game "The Last of Us Remastered". We can see our model provides recommendations of similar genre and gameplay.
